# MCP Ethical Hacking

![AI "Legitimate" image](./linkedin-mcp/linkedin_mcp/ai.png)


## 📚 Educational Purpose

This repository is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate the potential security risks in MCP implementations, and how to recognize and prevent security issues.

This repository contains "legitimate" tools for analyzing content from social media platforms using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It demonstrates both the capabilities and potential security implications of MCP tools.

These tools are provided for **educational purposes only** to demonstrate both the legitimate use cases and security considerations when developing and using MCP tools.

### 🛑 Disclaimer

This code is provided for educational purposes only. The authors do not endorse using these techniques for any malicious purposes. Always obtain proper authorization before analyzing content from any platform and respect their terms of service.

## 🔍 The "legitimate" use-cases

### MCP Toolkit: Social Media Content Analysis

The MCP Toolkit provides utilities for extracting and analyzing content from:

- **Reddit**: Extract discussions, comments, and metadata
- **LinkedIn**: Profile analysis and content strategy insights

## 📋 Components

The toolkit includes:

- **Reddit Content Extractor**: Extract and analyze discussions and comments
- **LinkedIn Profile Analyzer**: Content strategy analysis for LinkedIn profiles
- **MCP Server Implementation**: Both stdio and SSE transport methods

## ⚙️ Installation

[See Reddit Readme](./reddit-mcp) :: Using embedded code in a remote image    
[See Linkedin Readme](./linkedin-mcp) :: Using WebAssembly module embedded in a local image 

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

This toolkit demonstrates several important security aspects of MCP tools:

1. **Code Execution && Obfuscation Techniques**: The repository shows how MCP tools can execute code in unexpected ways, including:
   - Embedded code in images (steganography)
   - WebAssembly module execution
   - Remote data processing

2. **Data Access**: Tools can access and process data beyond what might be expected:
   - Network requests to third-party services
   - File system access

## 🔒 Best Practices

When developing or using MCP tools:

1. **Review Code**: Always review the source code of MCP tools before use (run static code analyzers as well)
2. **Sandbox Execution**: Run MCP tools in isolated environments
3. **Limit Permissions**: Use principle of least privilege
4. **Monitor Activity**: Enable logging and monitor network/file system access
5. **Authenticate Sources**: Only use tools from trusted sources
